Suppose if I want count the digits of number so remember,

methods of counting the digits :-

            first method is :-

"The number of times a number is divisible by 10 is the number of digits of that number."

int count_digits(int num){

    int count = 0;

    while (num > 0){
        count = count + 1;
        num = num / 10;
    }

    return count;
}


And the second method is :---

by taking log10 of number,

 if we do log10(7789),

 it will give 3.89 something.
 and if I add 1 to it will become 4.89
 and if take integer of it it will give us 4.

 so what can we do is 

 int count_digits(int num){
    int count = (int) log10(num) + 1;
    return count;
 }
